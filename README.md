#Pvalue Weighting Package for Matlab

This MATLAB package contains open source implementations of several p-value weighting methods, including Spjotvoll, exponential and Bayes weights. These are methods for improving power in multiple testing via the use of prior informaton. 

Please see the readme.pdf file for more information, including examples of using the code. For the details, consult the paper *Optimal Multiple Testing Under a Gaussian Prior on the Effect Sizes* by Dobriban, Fortney, Kim, Owen:  http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.02935

In addition, this package has all the code to reproduce the computational results of the above paper.

This package is not maintained, and provided only for convenience of Matlab users. The R package **pweight** (https://github.com/edgardobriban/pweight) is actively maintained and contains more functionality.
