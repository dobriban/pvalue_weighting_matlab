#Pvalue Weighting Package for Matlab

This MATLAB package contains open source implementations of several p-value weighting methods, including Spjotvoll, exponential and Bayes weights (proposed in Dobriban et al., 2015). These are methods for improving power in multiple testing via the use of prior informaton. 

Please see the readme.pdf file for more information, including examples of using the code.
