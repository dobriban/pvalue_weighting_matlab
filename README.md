Pvalue Weighting Package for Matlab

This MATLAB package contains open source implementations of several p-value weighting methods, including Spjotvoll, exponential and Bayes weights \citep[proposed in][]{dobriban2015optimal}. These are methods for improving power in multiple testing via the use of prior informaton.
